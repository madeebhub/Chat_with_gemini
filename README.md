# Chat_with_gemini 
I have designed and developed a user-friendly interface for an AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini. The goal was to create a smooth and interactive experience where users can easily communicate with the chatbot. The clean design focuses on accessibility, fast responses, and an intuitive flow, making it simple for anyone to use and get the information they need quickly.

Along with the chatbot integration, I also worked on creating a modern, responsive website design. Special attention was given to user convenience, ensuring that the layout, navigation, and interactions feel natural and easy to use across all devices. This project highlights my skills in frontend development, user experience design, and AI integration.
